The sample contains a small file (file.bin), with the following data:

id: 100
name: Test
type: 35
count: 3

// Block subs - repeat 3 times
subs0.id: 10
subs0.msg: Lorem

subs1.id: 12
subs1.msg: Ipsum

subs2.id: 14
subs2.msg: Dolor
// End of Block

(The count field means how many subs block there is in next line)

And a struct file (struct.txt), that contains a structure file to read this file.

=====================

To use it, just open the tool, go to "File > Open File" and choose "file.bin".
Now, go to "File > Open Struct" and choose "struct.txt".

After both are loaded, click Parse File, and the result will appear in result box.
